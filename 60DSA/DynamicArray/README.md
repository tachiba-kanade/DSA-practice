This a 60 days challange for me to understand the DSA concepts

- helps me to understand hirechy and the depth of the concepts as I'm someone who doesnt like competative programming.
- so this give me a sense of real life application of DSA rather just doing qs.
- so everyday 3-4 hours is dedicated for next 60 days , with each day being new concept to learn and understand the concept.
- even though im in web dev and mostly based projects on AI implementation and using JS but as i started in C++ in college days so figured to use this to understand the DSA, would be more usefull or atleast make sense

SO DAY 1

We have Dynamic Array :
I have mentioned the heirchy below to understand the concept and flow better

DynamicArray/
│
├── include/
│ └── DynamicArray.h
├── src/
│ ├── DynamicArray.cpp
│ └── main.cpp
├── Makefile
└── README.md

So while im doing this project ill tell you why i did, what did

Before we go into the logic of arrays

Q. Why we actually separate cpp file from header?

- code organized
  Header Files: Contain declarations of functions, classes, and variables.
  Implementation Files: Contain the actual code (definitions) of the functions and methods
- Reusability
- Reduced compilation time, as the corresponding file needs to be recompiled, rather than the entire project.
- Encapsulation: Header files provide a way to hide the implementation details and expose only the necessary interfaces to other parts of the program.
- Modularity: Helps in breaking down the program into smaller, manageable, and modular

lets create a menu of different functionalities of arrays!!! sounds fun
